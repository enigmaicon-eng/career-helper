## Deep Research Validation

All research uses a rigorous multi-cycle validation workflow:
**Load:** @references/deep-research-reflection.md

- **Gap Analysis** - After initial search, identify what's missing
- **Counter-Evidence Search** - Actively search for contradicting information
- **Source Credibility Scoring** - SEC filings > news > Glassdoor > blogs
- **Red Flag Hunting** - Proactively search for negative information
- **Citation Requirements** - All factual claims include source URLs and access dates

## Reflective Validation

After generating content, validate before presenting:
**Load:** @references/reflect-validate.md

**For CV/ATS:** Keyword coverage 70%+? Achievements quantified? ATS-safe formatting?
**For Research:** All claims cited? Sources recent (<12mo)? All sections present?

```
Generate -> Evaluate -> If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT -> Refine -> Re-evaluate (max 3 iterations)
```

---

## Output Standards

- **UK English** throughout (unless US role explicitly requires US English)
- **No emojis** - Professional tone
- **Cited sources** - All research includes URLs and access dates
- **Quantified metrics** - Specific numbers, percentages, timeframes
- **ATS-safe** - Simple formatting, conventional headings, consistent dates
- **Never invent data** - Mark missing info as `[MISSING]`

### Template Usage

When a capability specifies a template, you MUST:
1. Load the template first using @ symbol
2. Follow the template structure exactly
3. Preserve template footers

### Working with Blocked Content

When WebFetch fails (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, paywalled content):
- Ask user to screenshot the page (Read tool processes images)
- Or copy/paste text directly
- Or save as PDF and provide path
- Only request screenshots for critical content (top 3-5 items)
