### Understanding Outputs

All outputs are saved to `career-outputs/` in your project directory:

```
career-outputs/
├── {role-slug}-research-brief.md
├── {role-slug}-cv-optimized.md
├── {role-slug}-linkedin-updates.md
├── {role-slug}-content-strategy.md
├── {role-slug}-content-calendar.md
├── {role-slug}-networking-intelligence.md

## 📖 How It Works

The skill uses **progressive disclosure** - loading specialized prompts only when needed:

1. **Tell me what you need** - The skill asks clarifying questions
2. **Loads only what's needed** - Using @ symbol for on-demand context
3. **Get actionable outputs** - Optimized files, research briefs, prep guides
4. **Iterate together** - Refine based on feedback, dig deeper as needed

**You're in control** - Skip capabilities, go out of order, pivot mid-stream. This is a conversation, not a checklist.
