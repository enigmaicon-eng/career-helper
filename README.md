career-outputs/
├── {role-slug}-research-brief.md
├── {role-slug}-cv-optimized.md
├── {role-slug}-linkedin-updates.md
├── {role-slug}-content-strategy.md
├── {role-slug}-content-calendar.md
├── {role-slug}-networking-intelligence.md
├── {role-slug}-interview-prep.md

## 📖 How It Works

The skill uses **progressive disclosure** - loading specialized prompts only when needed:

1. **Tell me what you need** - The skill asks clarifying questions
2. **Loads only what's needed** - Using @ symbol for on-demand context
3. **Get actionable outputs** - Optimized files, research briefs, prep guides
4. **Iterate together** - Refine based on feedback, dig deeper as needed

**You're in control** - Skip capabilities, go out of order, pivot mid-stream. This is a conversation, not a checklist.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Career Stage Context
When you mention age, experience level, or stage-related concerns, the skill automatically loads career-stage-specific guidance to adapt all advice.

### Deep Research Validation (NEW)
All research uses a rigorous multi-cycle validation workflow:
- **Gap Analysis** - After initial search, explicitly identify what's missing
- **Counter-Evidence Search** - Actively search for information that contradicts initial findings
- **Source Credibility Scoring** - Weight sources by reliability (SEC filings > news > Glassdoor > blogs)
- **Red Flag Hunting** - Proactively search for negative information, layoffs, lawsuits, controversies
- **Citation Requirements** - All factual claims include source URLs and access dates

This ensures you get balanced, validated intelligence - not just the first search results.

### WebFetch Fallback
When content is blocked (LinkedIn profiles, Glassdoor reviews, paywalled articles), the skill asks you to provide it via:
- Screenshot (recommended - Read tool processes images)
- Copy/paste text
- PDF export

### Thread Series Strategy
For LinkedIn content, the skill provides guidance on when to use multi-post thread series:
