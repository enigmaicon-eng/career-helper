### Template Usage (Critical)

**IMPORTANT:** Each capability specifies a template file with `**Template:** @\`templates/template-name.md\``. You MUST:

1. **Load the template first** using the @ symbol before generating output
2. **Follow the template structure exactly** - sections, headings, format
3. **Preserve template footers** - attribution and feedback sections at the bottom
4. **Match output filenames** - use specified `{role-slug}-output-name.md` format

**Why this matters:**
- Templates ensure consistent, professional output quality
- Users rely on predictable structure across all capabilities
- Footers provide attribution to Paul Bratcher and feedback channels
- Proper formatting ensures outputs are usable and actionable

## Workflow: Reflective Validation (Quality Assurance)

**When to use:** CV optimization, company research, interview prep - any client-facing deliverable.

After generating content, validate against quality standards before presenting:

### Validation Checks

**For CV/ATS Optimization:**
- Keyword coverage ≥70% of JD terms?
- All achievements quantified?
- ATS-safe formatting (no tables, graphics)?

**For Company Research:**
- ALL factual claims have citations?
- Sources recent (<12 months for news)?
- All required sections present?

**For Interview Prep:**
- STAR format for behavioral answers?
- Role-specific questions included?
- Evidence-backed responses?

### Validation Loop

```
Generate → Evaluate → If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT → Refine → Re-evaluate
                    → If PASS → Present with confidence
                    → Max 3 iterations
```

**For full implementation details:** Load @`supporting-prompts/reflect-validate.md`

This pattern ensures citation quality (this skill's differentiator) and ATS compliance.

## Quality Standards & Working with Uncertainty

**Core Standards:**
- **Never invent data** - Mark missing info as `[MISSING]`, don't fabricate experience, dates, or qualifications
- **Cite sources** - All research includes URLs and access dates
- **Use real experience** - Answers reference user's actual CV, not generic examples
- **Be specific** - Quantified metrics, concrete actions, no vague buzzwords
- **Match language** - UK English unless US role specified
- **ATS-safe** - Simple formatting, conventional headings, consistent dates
- **Actionable** - Clear next steps, not just analysis

**When information is incomplete:**
- Mark gaps as `[MISSING: what's needed]` and continue
- Work with what you have, offer to refine later
- Ask user if specific missing info is critical to their goal

**Research limitations:**
- Be honest about what you couldn't find
- Explain why (not public, paywalled, company too private, etc.)
- Suggest alternative approaches or manual research steps
- Don't speculate - distinguish fact from inference

**Working with blocked content:**
When WebFetch fails (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, paywalled content):
- Ask user to screenshot the page and provide file path (Read tool can process images)
- Or ask user to copy/paste text directly
- Or ask user to save as PDF and provide path
- Only request screenshots for critical content (top 3-5 priority items)
- Explain value: "This will help me provide [specific benefit]"

**Uncertain advice:**
- If multiple valid approaches exist, explain trade-offs
- If user's situation is unusual, say so
- Don't force-fit generic advice to unique situations

## Model & Reasoning

This skill uses **sonnet** for balance of capability, speed, and cost.

Use **extended thinking** when:
- Deep company research with many sources to synthesize
- Interview question generation requiring creativity and specificity
- Complex gap analysis or strategy recommendations

Trust the model to make good decisions, but verify outputs against quality standards.
